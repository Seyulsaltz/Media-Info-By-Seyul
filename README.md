Note 1: Make a backup copy of your project folder.

Steps:
  1. Copy and paste this “script.exe” file, located inside “dist,” into your project.
  2. Run it, and when the process is complete, press Enter in the cmd to close it.

Note: If there are errors, such as when selecting the font, and it does not take effect, simply copy the contents of the “Resources” folder to your project.
